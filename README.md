# Movie-Recommendation-SystemThe Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning project designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences, past ratings, or movie content (e.g., genres). The system uses two popular approaches:

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to the ones a user already likes by analyzing movie metadata such as genres and keywords.

Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user behavior, identifying patterns and similarities between users and their ratings.

This project demonstrates how recommendation algorithms work and how they can be applied in real-world applications like Netflix, Amazon, or YouTube.
